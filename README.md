# edPDB
From [Chen et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09344). Intended for general projects in the lab, but also ok for software projects.

## Utility
- In each project's repository, open an Issue to discuss ideas, experiments, analyses, or literature.
  - Create Issue templates (e.g. for Literature, Ideas, Experiments, Analyses) to streamline this process.

## Usage
- Experiments, Analyses, Grants, Presentations, and Manuscripts go into separate folders.
- Each project contributor creates a sub-folder within the above folders to store their work.
- Do not store data files in the repository. Instead, create symbolic links from where the data is stored (e.g. server or cloud-based storage) so it can be easily accessed in the future.
- The described structure allows all users to be able push to the ```main``` branch without introducing merge conflicts, so we do not generally find added benefit in using branches.
