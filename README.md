# EdPDB
Edpdb: A Multi-Functional Tool for Protein Structure Analysis

EdPDB is a computer program to handle PDB (Brookhaven Protein Databank) format coordinate files.  It was written by X. Cai Zhang in Brian Matthews Lab at the University of Oregon. This repository is used for distribution of the Mac OS version of edPDB, and is maintained by Doug Juers. For the linux version of edPDB, please go [here.](https://github.com/cz-zhao-lab-ibp/edpdb) 

## Utility
edPDB can be used to perform **edits** and **calculations** on user **selected** atoms. Some simple examples are shown below. More extensive information is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/juerslab/software-edpdb/wiki) for this repository.

Selection
- select a particular chain
- select high B-factor atoms
- select atoms within some distance of other atoms


Edits
- replace the B-factor with a value from an external file
- change the chain marker
- subtract the center of mass values from each position

Calculation
- calculate mean and standard deviation of all B-factors
- calculate solvent accessible area
- calculate the moment of inertia 

## Installation
The executable included in this repository should run on Mac OS computers.
