# edPDB
edPDB is a computer program for editing pdb format files. It was written by Cai Zhang in Brian Matthews Lab at the University of Oregon.

## Utility
edPDB can be used to perform **edits** and **calculations** on user **selected** atoms. Some examples include:

Selection
- select a particular chain
- select high B-factor atoms
- select atoms within some distance of other atoms


Edits
- replace the B-factor with a value from an external file
- change the chain marker
- subtract the center of mass values from each position

Calculation
- calculate mean and standard deviation of all B-factors
- calculate solvent accessible area
- calculate the moment of inertia
